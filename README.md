# ERROR-DETECTION-AND-CORRECTION-
Designed a Hamming (7,4) Encoder and Decoder using Verilog as part of my #21RTLProjects series. This project detects and corrects single-bit errors in data transmission using parity logic. Simulated in Xilinx Vivado to validate real-time error correction at the hardware level.
